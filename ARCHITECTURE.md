# Architecture

This file describes the architecture inherited from Noctalia and the technical invariants that still apply to Nythera. It should be updated as Nythera's implementation diverges. Application-owned identifiers and code references below use Nythera. Upstream-hosted services keep their original endpoints. For code style, testing, commit conventions, and the project layout, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Event Loop

The main loop is poll based (`MainLoop` plus the `PollSource` interface). Every event source (Wayland, D-Bus, inotify, timers) exposes file descriptors that are polled together.

A new service implements `PollSource`, is added as an `Application` member, and is returned from `buildPollSources()`.
The shell uses the `MainLoop` constructor that owns bar shutdown by default. Independent native applications may supply their own stop predicate, poll-source provider and shutdown callback; shell lifecycle handling remains the default.

## UI Phases

Each surface runs explicit phases per frame:

1. `PrepareFrame`: tick animations, frame callbacks
2. `Update`: data and state synchronization
3. `Layout`: geometry and subtree rebuilds
4. `Render`: paint only

Rules:

- Never run layout or mutate the scene graph during Render.
- Structural rebuilds belong in Layout, state sync in Update; visual-only changes use `requestRedraw()`.
- Rebuild helpers (`rebuild...()`, `buildScene()`) are `private` and assert they are not running in the Render phase.
- Setters and callbacks schedule work instead of rebuilding directly:
  - `requestUpdate()` for data or state changes
  - `requestLayout()` for geometry or structure changes
  - `requestRedraw()` for paint-only changes
  - `requestFrameTick()` for data-fed animations that must apply data before painting
- Frame callbacks and configure handlers queue renders; they never render synchronously from Wayland dispatch.
- Scene-root swaps dispatch leave on the old tree and replay pointer enter on the new tree.

Guarded entry points: override the hook, not the public wrapper.

| Public entry                                       | Override                      |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `Node::layout()`                                   | `doLayout()`                  |
| `Node::measure()` / `Node::arrange()`              | `doMeasure()` / `doArrange()` |
| `Panel`, `Tab`, `Widget` `.layout()` / `.update()` | `doLayout()` / `doUpdate()`   |

Inside a hook, call the parent hook (for example `Flex::doLayout()`), not the public wrapper.

## Layer Boundaries

**Shell and widget code** (`src/shell/`) uses only controls from `src/ui/controls/` (`Label`, `Button`, `Glyph`, `Box`, `Separator`, ...). It never creates raw scene nodes such as `TextNode`, `RectNode`, or `IconNode`. `InputArea` is the only exception. Use `Box` for backgrounds, `Separator` for dividers, and `Label` for text.

**Controls** (`src/ui/controls/`) own the raw nodes.

- `Label::measure(Renderer&)` must be called after setting text and font, before positioning.
- Use `VirtualGridView` for fixed-size cell grids and `VirtualListView` for variable-height lists.
- A control composes its child nodes in its constructor, implements layout, and animates through `AnimationManager`.

**Composition**: prefer the declarative `ui::` builders (`ui::row`, `ui::column`, `ui::label`, `ui::button`, ...) wherever a builder exists. Use direct construction and setters only for properties or lifecycle work the builders cannot express. Primitive controls may construct their own internal nodes directly; they do not depend on the aggregate builder factory for that.

## Scene Graph and Input

`Node` is the scene graph base class. `InputArea` is a `Node` subclass for pointer hit testing, and `InputDispatcher` routes pointer events through the tree. `InputArea::setAcceptedButtons()` takes masks built with `InputArea::buttonMask(...)`, not raw `BTN_*` codes.

## Rendering

- `RenderContext` owns scene traversal and delegates drawing to a `RenderBackend`. Construct backends with `createDefaultRenderBackend()`.
- Texture allocation goes through `TextureManager`, constructed with `createDefaultTextureManager()`.
- Shell and widget code works with typed render concepts (`TextureId`, `TextureHandle`, `RenderFramebuffer`, `RenderSurfaceTarget`, nodes, draw primitives). Raw `GLuint` or EGL handles stay inside the render infrastructure.
- `RenderContext` does not own shader programs or include `render/programs/*`. Style and data structs live in neutral headers under `render/core/`.
- A new shader follows the same pattern: a GLES program in `src/render/programs/`, neutral data under `render/core/`, a typed `RenderBackend` draw method, and ownership by `GlesRenderBackend`.
- Text is rasterized with Pango and Cairo, uploaded through `TextureManager`, and drawn with `RenderBackend::drawGlyph()`.
- Async images are consumer scoped through `Image::setSourceFileAsync()` and `AsyncTextureCache::subscribeReady()`; there is no fan-out from `Application`.

**Rectangle shapes**: the rect shader is generic. Use per-corner `CornerShape::Convex` or `CornerShape::Concave` with `Radii` and `RectInsets logicalInset`. Panel and bar policy stays in shell code, not in shader enum names. Screen-corner overlays use the dedicated `ScreenCornerProgram` and `ScreenCornerNode` path.

### Native background haze

- Native surface hosts own haze profile IDs and per-instance pattern/time state. `SurfaceHaze` uses one shared TimerManager timer and normal Wayland frame readiness; static, disabled, closed and suspended hosts do not request haze frames. Haze redraws bypass unrelated content frame-tick callbacks.
- Existing background materials opt in through Box/Flex or screen-frame style flags. RenderContext supplies neutral `SurfaceHazeStyle` data; GLES rectangle and contour programs reuse one shader function. Foreground alpha and native shape coverage remain independent.
- Bars and islands are excluded. A bar/screen-wrap contour that includes an attached panel may shade only the explicit panel-body bounds under that panel's profile. Transparent input/capture planes do not gain synthetic backgrounds.
- Configuration retains `shell.panel.haze_*` paths and an independent `haze_surfaces` map; the Settings UI owns a dedicated Haze section. See [Nebula panel background](docs/nebula-background-poc.md) for coverage and lifecycle details.

### Fractional Scaling

- With `wp_fractional_scale_v1` and `wp_viewporter`, keep `set_buffer_scale(1)`, render at the preferred fractional scale, and set `wp_viewport.set_destination()` to the logical size.
- Set the `RenderContext` on a surface before its callbacks or `initialize()`.
- Configure-time builds call `makeCurrent()` and `syncContentScale()` before any layout, measurement, or texture work.
- Cross-surface callbacks sync the target surface's render scale.
- A fractional-scale change affects layout; text caches key on render scale and font generation.

### Text Vertical Centering

Vertical text centering lives in the `Label` engine, never in widgets. Widgets box-center the label and do no font math.

- In Text mode, `Label` places the baseline so the cap band is centered: `baselineOffset = height/2 + capHeight/2`.
- `capHeight` is the measured baseline-to-cap-top of `H` from `Renderer::measureFont().capHeight` for the label's own font family, a stable per-font value. It is not the OS/2 declared cap height, and not the label's own per-string ink.
- Do not center on the line box (`(ascent - descent)/2`); it places caps too high on fonts with a large descent.
- Do not pre-round text positions. `CairoTextRenderer::draw()` snaps the final glyph quad to the buffer pixel grid, so rounding earlier double-rounds and causes 1px drift. Round box and rect positions; leave text positions fractional.
- A label that is a single Private Use Area codepoint (`StringUtils::isSinglePrivateUseGlyph`) is an icon glyph. It is sized to its ink on both axes and centered on that ink instead of the cap band.
- `Label` ceils its box width, so the box is never narrower than the text.
- Line breaking is decided once, on the measure pass. The arrange pass reuses that wrap budget; an arrange width is a box size, not a new wrap request.
- When debugging alignment, instrument the real renderer (env-gated logging) instead of modelling it.

## Surfaces

### Panels

- Every panel (attached, detached, floating, centered) owns its own `nythera-panel` layer surface and draws its own background, shadow, blur, and reveal animation.
- "Attached" is a placement mode only: the panel's own surface is anchored to the bar's edge at the bar's layer, with a clipped reveal. It is not hosted in the bar surface.
- Workspace-map previews reuse `ToplevelThumbnailCapture::capture()` through one shared, serialized capture slot, keyed by compositor window ID. The initial visible snapshot sweep has no idle gap; ongoing previews share at most four captures per second, with adaptive backoff, rather than owning independent live sessions. Pause stops ongoing refreshes but still fills missing visible snapshots; dragging and native-window suspension gate capture work. Closing either host cancels capture and scheduling and drops the bounded frame cache.
- The expanded workspace map uses a native `ToplevelSurface`, like Settings, and hosts the same map content as the compact panel. Its input, move/resize requests and lifetime belong to the native window host; the compact map remains in `PanelManager`.
- A panel can opt into corner resizing through `PanelManager::beginPanelResize()`. The host owns surface resizing, output bounds, input regions and attached geometry; `Panel::onResizeFinished()` lets the owning panel remember its final size in UI state.
- Attached and single-bar detached placement is computed before commit against a specific bar on a specific output, so a panel needs a concrete output before commit. A NULL layer-shell output would mis-anchor it.

### Bars, Dock, and Layer Order

- `Bar` creates per-display instances through `WidgetFactory`. The `Widget` base follows a `create()`, `layout()`, `update()` lifecycle. A new bar widget subclasses `Widget` and is registered in `WidgetFactory`.
- Bar capsule cross-size derives from bar thickness, not widget content. `WidgetBarCapsuleSpec::enabled` controls outer capsule drawing; its size and style fields may still be populated for internal reuse.
- Bars are created before the dock. On hot reload geometry changes, recreate dock surfaces after bars.

### Shadows and Blur

- Shadow style is global (`ShellConfig::ShadowConfig`, `[shell.shadow]`). Components only expose `shadow = true|false`. Shared logic lives in `src/shell/surface/shadow.*`.
- Bar, dock, and notification surfaces always publish blur regions when the compositor supports them. There are no per-component blur toggles.

### Notification Toasts

Toast slots are stable for a toast's lifetime; surviving toasts keep their slot and new toasts fill freed slots. If every slot is hovered, new toasts queue off screen.

### Desktop Widgets

Desktop widgets live under `src/shell/desktop/` and do not use the bar `Widget` base. Use `wantsSecondTicks()` for clocks; use `needsFrameTick()` and `onFrameTick()` only for continuous animation.

## Compositor Integration

- `WaylandConnection` is protocol transport only, with no compositor-specific branches. Compositor behavior goes through `CompositorPlatform`.
- `WaylandConnection::Purpose::ApplicationClient` binds the ordinary xdg application protocols needed by standalone native apps and skips shell-only layer-shell and service globals. Shell remains the default purpose; screencopy connections retain their bounded sibling-connection path.
- Prefer passing `CompositorPlatform&` over passing both `WaylandConnection&` and `CompositorPlatform&`.
- `CompositorPlatform::outputWorkArea()` optionally supplies global logical bounds excluding reserved bars. Compositor-specific queries and parsing stay in the integration backend; callers fall back to full output bounds when metadata is unavailable.
- Detect compositors with `compositors::detect()`, `isHyprland()`, `isNiri()`, `isSway()`, and `isMango()` from `compositor_detect.h`; do not sniff environment variables again.
- Logout goes through `uwsm stop` when UWSM manages the compositor, otherwise compositor-native logout commands. Niri goes through `NiriRuntime` IPC, not the CLI.

## Configuration and State

- Schema structs and enums live in `src/config/config_types.*`. `ConfigService` owns lifecycle and hot reload. Override persistence lives in `src/config/config_overrides.cpp`.
- The settings GUI writes config overrides to `settings.toml`. Internal app and UI state lives in `state.toml` under owner tables (for example `[wallpaper_panel]`), accessed through `StateStore` or the `ConfigService` state APIs. Do not add ad hoc state files or hide internal state under config sections.
- Settings controls: `SearchPickerSetting` for large catalogs, `SelectSetting` for short dropdowns.
- Settings entries carry a `group`. Rendering routes through `coalesceByGroupKey()` (`settings_registry.h`), so each group renders once in first-appearance order. Still declare related entries together.

## IPC and D-Bus

- Register IPC handlers in the module that owns the behavior. Scripted-widget IPC is bar owned and target explicit.
- D-Bus services release their well-known names on disable or destroy.
- Daemon mode forks before IPC, GLib, D-Bus, or render initialization, then execs.
- The first completed async D-Bus state snapshot is a baseline, not a user-visible transition.
- StatusNotifier and DBusMenu: tray apps may be non-standard, so method and property failures are non-fatal. Menu layout loading is async and retained; popup creation never blocks on synchronous D-Bus calls.

## Services

- **Idle**: `IdleManager` runs `ext_idle_notifier_v1` behaviors. Each `[idle.behavior.*]` has a `command` and an optional `resume_command`. `nythera:dpms-off` gets an automatic `nythera:dpms-on` on resume. `pre_action_fade_seconds` drives `IdleGraceOverlay` on overlay layer surfaces.
- **PipeWire**: access SPA pod arrays with the stable `SPA_POD_ARRAY_*` macros from `spa/pod/pod.h`, not `spa_pod_get_array_full()` (added in PipeWire 1.6, absent in 1.4). Cast macro results from `size_t` to `uint32_t` explicitly.
- **Clipboard**: large payloads are written across `POLLOUT` ticks; do not close the send fd on `EAGAIN`.
- **Weather**: `auto_locate` is best effort and uses the cached location on failure. `[shell].offline_mode = true` disables all HTTP traffic. Never log coordinates or location names.
- **Brightness**: keep the service instance stable across reloads and hotplug, since consumers hold raw pointers. Check `BrightnessDisplay::controllable` before exposing writes. Read the `brightness` sysfs file, not `actual_brightness`.

## Plugins

- Plugins are trusted Luau code: installing one is equivalent to running a user-owned script. There is no permission broker, capability sandbox, consent prompt, or path sandbox. Luau sandboxing exists only for VM and global-state isolation.
- A distributable plugin is a directory with one static `plugin.toml`. There are no single-file `define{}` plugins and no manifest defaults in script code.
- Canonical ids are `author/plugin` and `author/plugin:entry`. Entry types are `[[widget]]`, `[[shortcut]]`, `[[service]]`, `[[desktop_widget]]`, `[[launcher_provider]]`, `[[panel]]`, and `[[layer]]`.
- Defaults live once in `plugin.toml`. Plugin code reads them with `nythera.getConfig(key)` or `barWidget.getConfig(key)`; undeclared keys are loud misses. Plugin-level overrides live under `[plugin_settings."author/plugin"]`.
- Plugin bar widgets use the normal named `[widget.<name>]` settings, so separate widget names can reuse one plugin entry with different settings. Entry-specific settings belong to the owning surface's config model.
- Git and path source lifecycle belongs to `PluginManager` and `plugin_git.*`. Source names and plugin ids are validated flat identifiers before they touch paths. Git sources use an app-managed repo cache and exported runtime files (no sparse checkout); `path` sources are for local development.
- Changes to the plugin-facing API (bindings in `src/scripting/luau_host.cpp` and `src/scripting/plugin_bindings.cpp`, the `ui.*` prelude in `src/scripting/ui_prelude.h`, or the entry callbacks the host calls) require matching updates to `docs/plugin-api.json` and Nythera's plugin documentation. The external official-plugins repository still supplies `noctalia.d.luau`; that upstream API is translated at source ingestion as described in [REBRAND.md](REBRAND.md).

## Theming and Style

- Style constants live in `src/ui/style.h`, colors in `src/ui/palette.h`. Controls aim for a rounded, comfortably spaced look tuned for a native 1080p desktop.
- Terminology: `Palette` is a resolved RGB set, `ColorRole` a named slot, `ColorSpec` a role or fixed value. User-facing strings say "color role"; "theme" refers to the `[theme]` palette subsystem.
- `FixedPaletteMode` carries `dark` and `light`, each with a UI `palette` and a nested `terminal` palette.
- Palette JSON (community, custom, `nythera theme --theme-json`) carries a top-level integer `version`; a file without one is format 1. Format 2 keys are the color role names (`on_primary`, `surface_container`, terminal `selection_fg`), listed once in `kFixedPaletteJsonKeys`. `src/theme/fixed_palette_json.cpp` upgrades older formats in memory on read and rejects newer ones. Community palette requests send `?version=<kPaletteFormatVersion>`, and the API answers with at most that format, converting newer palettes down so older shells keep working.
- Built-in template hooks live beside their template (for example `assets/templates/fuzzel/apply.sh`). Community templates are fetched from `https://api.noctalia.dev/templates` and cached under `$XDG_STATE_HOME/nythera/community-templates`. Template application runs on a background worker.
- Glyph names resolve through `src/render/text/glyph_registry.cpp`: curated aliases, then `U+`/`0x` codepoints, then Tabler names from `tabler.json`. C++ glyph literals belong in the curated registry.

## Launcher

Results dispatch activation only to the provider that produced them. Fuzzy scoring uses the vendored `third_party/fzy`. Desktop entry scanning follows XDG data-dir precedence.
